# Wallpapers
In this section you will find wallpapers created by the Anarchy Linux community. Some of them will be part of the distribution installation.

## Do you want to collaborate? You're welcome!
Anyone can create a wallpaper under certain conditions, necessary to maintain order and homogeneity:

 **1.** The wallpaper must not possess any type of logo or brand other than Anarchy Linux
 
 **2.**  Works carried out under CC BY-NC-SA licenses are allowed
 
 **3.** The resolutions must be 1024 x 768, 1280 x 1024, 1920 x 1080 (pixels) or following the [common screen resolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution#Common_display_resolutions)
 
 The current structure must be maintained, and the wallpapers created by the community must be pushed to their respective folder.
